## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Setup Backend
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-platform.git
   cd job-platform
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask server:
   ```sh
   flask run
   ```

### Setup Frontend
1. Open `index.html` in a browser or run using Live Server extension in VS Code.
2. Ensure the frontend is correctly making API requests to the backend.
